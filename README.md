# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Multiple Datasets

This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on four different datasets. The analyses are aimed at uncovering insights and patterns in the data, and each dataset represents a unique use case.

# Datasets

# Dewali Sales:

## Description: Sales data related to the Dewali festival.
- Key Analysis: Sales trends over time, seasonal effects, and product performance during the festival.
- File: dewali_sales/data/dewali_sales.csv
Student Result Dataset:

## Description: Data on student performance across various subjects and examinations.
- Key Analysis: Academic achievements, performance distribution, correlation between subjects, and demographic insights.
- File: student_results/data/student_results.csv
Superstore Dataset:

## Description: Retail sales data from a superstore, including sales transactions, customer information, and product details.
- Key Analysis: Sales performance by region, product category analysis, customer segmentation, and sales trends.
- File: superstore/data/superstore.csv
Titanic Dataset:

## Description: Passenger data from the Titanic disaster, including demographic details and survival information.
- Key Analysis: Survival rates by demographic factors, impact of various features on survival, and data distribution.
- File: titanic/data/titanic.csv
## Features

- Classic Gameplay: Enjoy the traditional Snake game where you control the snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.
- Turtle Graphics: Uses Python's Turtle module to create and manage the game graphics.
- Dockerized: The application is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy setup and consistent execution across different environments.
## Technologies Used

- Python (3.x): Main programming language for data analysis.
- Numpy: For mathematical and Statistical computations.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- Matplotlib: Plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for documenting and executing code.
## Prerequisites

- Python (3.x): Ensure Python 3.x is installed. You can download it from the official website.
- Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed

## Analyzing Each Dataset


- Dewali Sales: Explore sales patterns specific to the Dewali festival, identify high-performing products, and analyze seasonal trends.
- Student Results: Investigate student performance metrics, analyze patterns and correlations, and visualize the distribution of scores.
- Superstore: Examine sales data by region, analyze product performance, and understand customer behavior.
- Titanic: Assess factors affecting survival rates, visualize demographic data, and identify key features impacting survival.
